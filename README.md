Console.IO is a program which was constructed for the purpose of handling input and output from the user via the MVC model. Console.IO is injected into another program via dependency injection such that it is invoked to handle (ideally) all validation of user input in console based programs. Moreover, ConsoleIO has the responsibility of converting user input into objects (doubles, Dates, LocalDates, ints, ints within range, etc.).
